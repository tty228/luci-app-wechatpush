- Telegram bot                              https://t.me/BotFather
- Due to limited resources, if you need DingTalk push, Feishu push, Bark push, etc., please try https://github.com/zzsj0928/luci-app-pushbot.
- Dependencies: iputils-arping + curl + jq commands. Before installing, please run opkg update. Be cautious when installing on routers with limited memory.

## Main Features

- Push notifications for changes in router IP and IPv6.
- Push notifications for device online/offline status.
- Device online list and traffic usage.
- CPU load and temperature monitoring, PVE host temperature monitoring.
- Periodic push notifications for router status.
- Web and SSH login prompts for the router, automatic blacklist and port knocking.
- Unattended tasks.

## Known Issues

- Developed based on X86 OpenWrt v23.05.0 Different systems and devices may encounter various problems. If you encounter errors in temperature information retrieval, display errors, or other issues, please adapt accordingly.
- Some devices may not have device names available. The script uses the `cat /tmp/dhcp.leases` command to read device names. If the device name is not present in DHCP (e.g., for relay router devices, devices with static IP, or when OpenWrt is used as a bypass gateway), the device name cannot be read. Please use device name remarks or configure to obtain it from the optical modem in advanced settings.
- Device online status is detected using active device connection probing to avoid Wi-Fi sleep mechanism. Active probing takes time. If devices frequently go into sleep mode, please adjust the timeout settings accordingly.
- Traffic statistics functionality depends on wrtbwmon. Install or compile it yourself. This plugin conflicts with Routing/NAT, Flow Offloading, and other plugins. Enabling them will result in no traffic statistics. Please choose accordingly.

## PS

- When submitting a bug, please provide device information, logs, descriptions such as the output and log information after executing `/usr/share/serverchan/serverchan`, and file information in the `/tmp/serverchan/` directory. Please also include detailed execution information of `sh -x /usr/share/serverchan/serverchan t1`.
